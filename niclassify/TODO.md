# TODO

- write prompt-based interface
- organize/refactor code
- start GUI?
- increase error checking
- try to add optional error fixing on top of error checking
- save log output to file
- rewrite nerr/ierr to support any number of class labels (and ensure program support n labels)
  - this will be a pain (sorry), especially in the rename thing
  - use a confusion matrix?
